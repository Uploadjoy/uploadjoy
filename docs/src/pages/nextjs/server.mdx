# @uploadjoy/next/server

This is the API documentation for @uploadjoy/next/server thats covers setting up an API endpoint for your Next.js application to interact with the Uploadjoy API.

## Usage

After installing `@uploadjoy/next`, create a new API route in your Next.js application at `pages/api/uploadjoy/[...actions].ts`.

You can then import the `Uploadjoy` Next.js API handler and pass it your Uploadjoy API key like this:

```ts
import { Uploadjoy } from "@uploadjoy/next/server";

export default Uploadjoy({
  apiKey: "apiKey",
});
```

## Configuration

Refer to the following type definitions below for the `Uploadjoy` function configuration options:

```ts
/**
 * Discriminated union return type for the `canUpload` function.
 */
type CanUploadReturnType =
  | {
      canUpload: true;
    }
  | {
      canUpload: false;
      // optional error message to return to the client for debugging
      message?: string;
    };

/**
 * Configuration options for the Uploadjoy Next.js API handler.
 */
type Options = {
  apiKey: string;
  /**
   * Optional function to check if the user is allowed to upload files, or
   * perform any other middleware logic. This function runs _before_ the
   * presigned URLs are fetched from the Uploadjoy API.
   *
   * @param ctx - Context object containing the file access, files, and folder
   * @param req - Next.js request object
   * @param res - Next.js response object
   * @returns - Promise that resolves to an object with a `canUpload` boolean.
   *  If `canUpload` is `false`, the request will be rejected with a 403 status
   * code. If `canUpload` is `true`, the request will continue to fetch
   * presigned URLs from the Uploadjoy API.
   */
  canUpload?: (
    ctx: {
      fileAccess: GetPresignedUrlOpts["fileAccess"];
      files: GetPresignedUrlOpts["files"];
      folder: GetPresignedUrlOpts["folder"];
    },
    req: NextApiRequest,
    res: NextApiResponse
  ) => Promise<CanUploadReturnType> | CanUploadReturnType;

  /**
   * Optional custom API url to use instead of the default Uploadjoy API url.
   * Mainly used for testing internally.
   */
  customApiUrl?: string;
};
```
