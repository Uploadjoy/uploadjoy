# API Documentation

Use the Uploadjoy API to seamlessly create presigned URLs, manage multipart uploads, and more without the need to configure and manage your own S3 buckets. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Getting started

To get started, create a new project within Uploadjoy and a new API key within the project's developer settings. An API key is necessary to make API calls using our dedicated client SDKs. Once you have created and saved your API key, you are ready to start building with Uploadjoy. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>API keys are scoped to the specific project it was created in.</Note>
